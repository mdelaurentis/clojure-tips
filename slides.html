# Laziness

What does `map` do?

```clojure
user=> (doc map)
-------------------------
clojure.core/map
([f coll] [f c1 c2] [f c1 c2 c3] [f c1 c2 c3 & colls])
  Returns a lazy sequence consisting of the result of applying f to the
  set of first items of each coll, followed by applying f to the set
  of second items in each coll, until any one of the colls is
  exhausted.  Any remaining items in other colls are ignored. Function
  f should accept number-of-colls arguments.
```

```clojure
user=> (doc doseq)
-------------------------
clojure.core/doseq
([seq-exprs & body])
Macro
  Repeatedly executes body (presumably for side-effects) with
  bindings and filtering as provided by "for".  Does not retain
  the head of the sequence. Returns nil.
```

# Laziness


```
            Will you consume the result?

                Will consume          Will not consume


Need side      (doall (map f coll))      (doseq [c coll]
effects        or (loop ...)             (f c))


Don't need     (map f coll)              What is 
side effects                            wrong with you?
